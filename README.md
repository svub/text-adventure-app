**Note: I don't currently maintain this project. All changes are done directly in the Hollow White repository (which is based on this one there). If you're interested in using this framework for creating interactive text adventures, get in touch with me or open an issue. I would love to back port all the improvements here but I just don't have the time and motivation right now to do it. Seeing another project wanting to use this framework and/or somebody being willing to help would for sure change that!**

# Text Adventure App

> Turn your writings into an interactive app that blends game and book into one experience.

## Project setup

The idea when working with this souce code is to create your own repository first, it will be the one with your customizations to it &mdash; CSS changes mostly &mdash; and then add this repo as a new remote.
```
mkdir my-new-text-adventure-app
cd my-new-text-adventure-app
git init
git remote add app git@github.com:svub/text-adventure-app.git
```

Now you can add the latest Text Adventure App code to your project like this:
```
git pull app
```

While working on your book app, you wonÂ´t need to update the app code usually. If you want to update to the latest version though, it goes like this:
* First, fetch the new code
* Check if the changes are fine with you, e.g. check if an import change of yours would be overwritten, 
* And if your OK with everything, merge the new version in
```
git fetch app
git diff ..app/main
git merge app/main
```

```
yarn install
```

### Test your app locally
```
yarn serve
```

### Compile and minify for production
```
yarn build
```
